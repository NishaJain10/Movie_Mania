# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Movie Mania

My latest full-stack project, **Movie Mania**, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)! This movie website delivers a seamless user experience with a robust set of features:

## Features

🔒 **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure registration and login processes, with data stored in a MongoDB database. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensure user verification and secure access control.

📊 **Data Visualization**: Dynamic content display using React to fetch and present movie details, user reviews, and ratings in an engaging format. Real-time updates keep users informed about the latest movies.

🛠️ **CRUD Functionality**: Full CRUD operations for movie and user data, allowing for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of information. The admin panel provides exclusive tools for managing these operations efficiently.

🛡️ **Admin Panel**: A secure admin dashboard for managing user information and movie listings. Admins can edit or delete user data, view and respond to messages, and manage movie content with ease. Unauthorized users attempting to access this panel will be denied.

📬 **Contact Page**: Logged-in users can send messages through a dedicated contact page. These messages are managed in the admin panel, allowing for prompt and organized communication.

🎥 **Service Page**: Detailed movie service information is dynamically displayed, providing users with comprehensive details about each movie, including descriptions, genres, and release dates.

❗ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure a smooth user experience, with clear and informative error messages guiding users through any issues.

🗣️ **User Feedback**: Instant feedback is provided through toast messages for actions such as login, registration, and error occurrences, enhancing user interaction and satisfaction.

🔗 **API Integration**: Thorough API testing with Postman ensures reliable backend functionality and seamless integration with the frontend, delivering a consistent and robust user experience.
